Key Differences Between Sleep and Wait Method in Java

    The main point that distinguishes the sleep and wait method is that sleep method 
    holds the lock on the object till it is interrupted or its time expires. 
    However, the wait method releases the lock on the object that invokes it and 
    gives other objects the chance to execute.
    
    The sleep method is defined in the Thread class whereas, the wait method is 
    defined in the Object class.
    
    The sleep method need not be called from synchronised context. But the wait 
    method needs to be called from synchronised.
    
    The sleep method is awakened if the time of the method is expired or it is 
    interrupted by the other thread. The wait method is awakened when the notify 
    or notifyAll method is invoked.
    
    The sleep method is static method whereas, the wait method is not a static method.
    
    The sleep method is executed on the current thread whereas, the wait method is 
    executed on the object that invokes it.
    
    The exception thrown by sleep  method is InterruptedException whereas the 
    exceptions thrwon by wait method are IllegalArgumentException, 
    IllegalMonitorStateException, InterruptedException.


Conclusion:

When multiple threads are wants to use the same resource one by one, then the wait 
method must be used. When a thread does not want to perform any task, then sleep 
method must be used.

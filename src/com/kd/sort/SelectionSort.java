/**
 * https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/selection_sort_algorithm.htm
 * 
 * Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm.
 * This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, 
 * the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. 
 * Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.
 * The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, 
 * and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.
 * This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexities are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.
 *
